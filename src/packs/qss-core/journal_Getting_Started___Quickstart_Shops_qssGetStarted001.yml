        <p>Hey Team!</p><p></p><p>Thank you so much for checking out
        <strong>Quickstart Shops</strong>!</p><p></p><p>I built this module
        because, frankly, I was tired of the paralysis that came with designing
        shops from scratch. I was drowning in complexity or staring at a blank
        screen with no direction. Most shop systems I tried were too vague or
        too bloated for what I needed at the table. So I decided to make
        something that just works to give GMs a solid, functional foundation
        with the flexibility to grow.</p><p></p><p>What surprised me was how
        quickly people found it. Within hours of posting, Quickstart Shops was
        installed in dozens of Foundry worlds, which blew me away. Thank you for
        giving it a shotâ€”it means more than I can say.</p><p></p><p>There's
        still a lot more I want to do with this module, so keep an eye out for
        updates! A full "how to use" guide is on the way soon to walk you
        through everything it can do (and help spark ideas for customizing it
        for your world).</p><p></p><p>Thanks again for your supportâ€”and happy
        shopping! ðŸ›’</p><p></p><p>~Sebastian</p>

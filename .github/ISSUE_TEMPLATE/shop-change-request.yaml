        This form is **only for requesting an item be added, removed, or its quantity changed** in a specific **Quickstart Shop** journal.

        **Note**:
        - This **does not** affect shops that have already been imported into a world.
        - This is a change **request**, not a guarantee.
        - Please provide a clear rationale for the change—there are no hard rules yet, but we value thoughtful feedback.

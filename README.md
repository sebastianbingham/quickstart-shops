# Quickstart Shops

![Dynamic JSON Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsebastianbingham%2Fquickstart-shops-metrics%2Fmain%2Fmetrics%2Finstall-count.json&query=installs&label=VTT%20Worlds%20Installed%20In&color=%23FE6A1F)

**Quickstart Shops** is a lightweight, plug-and-play Foundry Virtual Tabletop (VTT) **module** built around [Monk's Enhanced Journal](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-enhanced-journal). It delivers prebuilt shop templates for a variety of classic fantasy store types—ready to drop into your world with zero prep.

This module is designed to save GMs time by providing curated shop inventories, streamlined tagging and navigation, and a solid foundation for future expansion.

> ⚠️ **Monk's Enhanced Journal is required.**  
> 📘 Integration with the *Player’s Handbook (2024)* and *Dungeon Master’s Guide (2024)* is **recommended** — and must be purchased on FoundryVTT for full functionality.

## 🎨 About the Art

All shop icons are currently AI-generated placeholders. These serve to provide visual clarity and faster development—but I welcome the opportunity to replace them with commissioned artwork in the future.

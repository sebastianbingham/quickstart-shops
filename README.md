# Quickstart Shops

**Quickstart Shops** is a Foundry Virtual Tabletop (VTT) module that expands on [Monk's Enhanced Journal](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-enhanced-journal) by providing ready-to-use, categorized shops for your in-game world. This module makes it easy to drop in immersive, prebuilt stores for your players with minimal prep.

> ⚠️ **Monk's Enhanced Journal is a required dependency.**  
> 📘 Integration with the *Player’s Handbook (2024)* and *Dungeon Master’s Guide (2024)* is **recommended** — and they must be purchased on FoundryVTT for the corresponding shops to function correctly.

## 🎨 About the Art

The store icons were generated using AI to avoid delays in module development. I'm **not an artist**, and this was a practical solution to keep things moving. I’m **open to working with artists** to replace these icons with commissioned artwork in the future. Reach out if you're interested!
